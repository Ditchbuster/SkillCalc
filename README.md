This is a profession calculator for SWGEmu written in C#.
Plans are to make this an all in one tool with other tools integrated into it.

You must reference the System.Data.SQLite.dll for this to compile.

This is the priliminary version of this tool.

I made this in my free time and with some haste to get a viable usable tool out for people to enjoy.
Future work is planned and cleanup  or fixes are  encourgaged to be submitted.
